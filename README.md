# Data Processing with R 

Building on the material covered by [R Programming](https://github.com/johnpinney/r_programming), this workshop will introduce the _tidyverse_ packages, which support advanced data processing and visualisation in R.

The following topics will be covered:

- R as a data-handling environment
- The _tidyverse_ packages
- Reading tabular data with _readr_
- Tidying data with _tidyr_
- Transforming data with _dplyr_
- Data visualisation with _ggplot2_
- Applying statistical tests to tabular data
